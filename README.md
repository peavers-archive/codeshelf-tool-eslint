# Codeshelf Tool ESLINT
Send the output from executing ESLINT to AWS Firehose

---

## Why
Just playing around with Firehose and seeing what cool server side processing I can do with it

## Running
You'll need to make sure the environment variables found in the application.yml fire are correctly set. 

The working directory should be the `src` directory of a javascript based project. 

## W.I.P
Remember just a random messing about, a random work in possibly never progress ;)
